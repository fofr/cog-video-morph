Generate a video that morphs between subjects, with an optional style

https://replicate.com/fofr/video-morpher

Based on my [ComfyUI cog repo](https://github.com/fofr/cog-comfyui) and ipivâ€™s excellent ComfyUI workflow: "[Morph - img2vid AnimateDiff LCM](https://civitai.com/models/372584/ipivs-morph-img2vid-animatediff-lcm)".

You can:

- generate a video that morphs between 4 subjects
- provide an optional style to apply to the whole video
- pick the aspect ratio of your video
- decide on the quality, small, medium, upscaled or interpolated
